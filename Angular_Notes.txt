COMPONENT BASED APPROACH
	trying to figure out different portions of a web-page that can separated out and can be created as a individual components
	A component in Angular can be considered as a small application with an associated template. It has a selector and will (usually) render the template, whereever the selector-tag is located.
	e.g.
	Root
		header
		side-bar
			nav
			updates
		main-area
			info-section
			details-section
		footer

SETUP
	pre-requisites:
		Node.js (for front-end)
		Angular CLI package:
			Angular CLI is a tool to to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications
			to install angular cli package use command "npm install -g @angular/cli"
	
	Enter the project initialization commands
		ng new my-first-project                // to initialize a new angular project with all required angular dependencies
		cd my-first-project                    // move the project directory
		ng serve                               // builds the project and start hosting the locally in default port(4200)

	Some terms from the initialized project:
		index.html    : default home page/teplate for the application
		main.ts       : default typescript file to hold the client side logic for the project
		style.css     : default style sheet for th project
		package.json  : list the dependencies which the project is using
		src           : a placeholder directory for holding the source code for the project
		src/app       : a placeholder directory for holding angular components. contains the 'app-root' component
		src/app/app.module.ts : also called root module, configures the project as an independent module. This AppModule is called by default from the main.ts
